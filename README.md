### About me:
Hi I'm my name is Jason ( A.K.A. Jacksonbird8237 )  
I  completed an online bootcamp and am currently going to college so I can then pursue a career in coding.

I am currently working on TheMessengerItemTracker which is a item tracker for the game 'The Messenger' currently made in html, css, and js.

I like helping people out with their projects when I have time available to do so.

I currently know Java, C#, and a little bit of JavaScript.

You can reach me at my email jkbirdstar@gmail.com
